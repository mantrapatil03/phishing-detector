Phishing Detection — Security Policy & Responsible Disclosure

🔖 Overview

The Phishing Detection project prioritizes security, privacy, and model integrity across all stages — from data ingestion to deployment.
This document defines our security practices, responsible disclosure guidelines, and risk mitigation strategies for contributors, users, and researchers.

🧩 Supported Versions
Version	Supported	Security Patches
main (latest)	✅	Actively maintained
v1.x	⚠️	Critical fixes only
Pre-release branches	❌	Not monitored for vulnerabilities

Always deploy the latest stable version. Outdated dependencies or models may expose security risks.

📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously.
If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately and responsibly.

📬 Contact Options

Include in Your Report

Summary of the issue and potential impact.

Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept (if safe).

Affected files or components.

Suggested mitigation (optional).

Our Commitment

Response: within 48–72 hours

Verification & Fix: within 7–14 business days

Acknowledgment: optional credit in SECURITY_CREDITS.md or release notes

We follow ISO/IEC 29147:2018
 and CVD (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure)
 principles.

🔐 Responsible Disclosure Policy

To protect the community and our users:

You agree not to:

Disclose the issue publicly before it is fixed.

Access, modify, or damage non-public systems or data.

Conduct denial-of-service, data exfiltration, or privacy-invasive tests.

We commit to:

Transparent and timely communication.

Fair credit and recognition.

Non-retaliation toward researchers acting in good faith.

🧠 Machine Learning Security Policy
1. Model Integrity & Verification

Every model in /models/ is cryptographically hashed (SHA-256).

Use the verification utility in ml_helpers.py:

from src.ml_helpers import verify_model_integrity
verify_model_integrity("models/baseline.joblib", "expected_hash_here")


All model updates are signed and version-tagged via Git.

2. Adversarial & Data Poisoning Defense

Continuous evaluation against adversarially crafted URLs and feature perturbations.

Automatic data validation pipelines in data_processing.py flag statistical anomalies.

Isolation of untrusted or external datasets to sandboxed environments.

3. Privacy & Data Protection

Strict adherence to GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001 principles for data handling.

Sensitive data (API keys, tokens) stored only in .env and excluded via .gitignore.

Use dotenv and encrypted storage for runtime secrets.

🐳 Deployment & Infrastructure Security
Category	Recommended Practice
Isolation	Run the system in Docker with non-root users and minimal privileges.
Network	Limit open ports, enforce HTTPS, use firewalls & reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx).
Secrets	Manage credentials via secure vaults (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, or Doppler).
Environment	Never commit .env files. Example configuration provided as .env.example.
Dependencies	Pin all dependencies and run pip-audit weekly for CVE checks.
Image Security	Use tools like Trivy, Grype, or Dockle to scan base images.
Logging	Sanitize logs to prevent leakage of sensitive URLs or credentials.
Monitoring	Integrate with centralized SIEM systems (ELK, Grafana Loki, Wazuh).
🧪 Continuous Security Integration (CI/CD)

This repository uses GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/ci.yml) for automated security enforcement:

Check	Tool / Action	Purpose
Static Code Analysis	bandit, flake8	Detects insecure code patterns
Dependency Scanning	pip-audit, Dependabot	Flags vulnerable libraries
Model Integrity	Custom SHA verifier	Ensures no tampered ML artifacts
Container Scan	aquasecurity/trivy-action	Checks Docker image CVEs
Secrets Scan	gitleaks	Prevents secret leakage during commit
🧱 Hardening Guidelines
For Contributors

Run pre-commit hooks to lint and check for secrets before pushing code.

Keep branches rebased with main to receive patched security updates.

Use virtual environments (venv, conda, or Docker dev containers`).

For Deployers

Rotate all keys and credentials periodically.

Enforce least-privilege IAM roles.

Audit Docker and server logs monthly.

Configure security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options).

🧾 Security Audit & Compliance Log
